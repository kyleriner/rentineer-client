This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to the Rentineer Austin Client. This project showcases my full-stack web development skills utilizing a variety of technologies. I wanted to build this project because I always wanted to see how hard it really is to build out a fully functional website that takes in data from all over the country and has thousands or millions of data points. I decided on an apartment search themed website, as it also provided me with experience in utilizing mapping software. 

## Front-End Technologies

In the Front-End, I use Javascript, React, Redux, React Router, and MapBox. I had originally intended on using Google Earth, however their API was severly lacking the ease of use that MapBox provided, as well as lacking the important feature of Heatmaps that I wanted to experiment with. Overall I enjoyed using the most advanced technologies I had used since my time at Flatiron, and they showed me the wide world of easy to use, hard to master technologies that make my life as a programmer so much easier.

## Features

Rentineer Austin allows a user to browse a map of Austin and see all the apartments available within city limits. I limited my data to 6 zip codes around downtown, as the API I am using could begin charging my for my use of all this data should I have included many more. Nevertheless, I display a map with icons denoting apartments, which may be clicked to see more data about them. I also include filters for the map, as well as mapping information, at the top left, where one may turn the icons on or off, show only their favorites, and toggle the heatmap. The heatmap shows red where the prices are higher, and more towards green where they are relatively lower.
